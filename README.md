The code for my sumo bot, a project for my TEJ2OI tech course in grade 10.

**The bot uses**:

* A CHRP3 pcb, custom made by my tech teacher and robotics club teacher [Mr. Rampelt](https://www.siriusmicro.com/index.html), baked in with a few microcontrollers, LEDs, buttons, a piezo beeper, space for an LCD screen, and more. This is all powered by 4 AA batteries.
* 2 servo motors
* A sonar sensor
* And a few 3D printed attatchments
